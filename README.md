Welcome to Orbital Defense!

The Earth is in danger and you are the only one who can save it!

A massive unknown object has barrelled into the moon, causing all manner of debree to get caught in the Earth's gravitational pull and come crashing down towards the planet!

Hop in your lone space fighter and blast the incoming debree to save the planet!

Orbital Defense is a top down 'runner' in which the player needs to stop all incoming objects from striking the Earth and destroying us all.
